Adafruit_CharLCDPlate_App
=========================

A base for creating apps using the LCD screen and buttons.  Button presses are turned into events, handled by overwriting the handleEvent method.  You have full control over knowing when the buttons are pressed/held down and can interact with the display in the meantime.
